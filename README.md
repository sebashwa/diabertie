This is your personal diabetes chatbot.
It uses the awesome [Telegram](https://telegram.org) [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
You can send Diabertie your blood sugar levels, insulin doses and whatever is important for your daily diabetes logging.
For a detailed documentation on how to use this bot there is a [comprehensive guide](https://sebashwa.github.io/diabertie/) on that.
